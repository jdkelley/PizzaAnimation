# PizzaAnimation
Pizza with Morfed View

This is the design concept made real in code. The animated interface was accomplished by <a href="http://tubikstudio.com" rel="nofollow">Tubik Studio</a> and presented on <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2736160-GIF-Animation-for-Recipes-and-Cooking" rel="nofollow">Dribbble</a>. The concept presents interactions livened with motion design. The challenging task for developer here was to implement the sophisticated animation and we made major accent on the special effect of stretching cheese on the pizza.


Here is how it looks in this project:
